Need to create a website from sketches,
1) front-end development (React JS)
2) smart contract development (Solidity)

The general goal of this project is to build a marketplace, allowing users to buy and sell assets related to their virtual properties via the means of decentralized web technology.
Each asset will be uniquely identified using a token abstraction, known as Non-Fungible Token (NFT).


Core functionality:
● NFT Token Minting
● NFT Marketplace

Working Assumptions
● ERC-721 standard is used as the building block of the asset traceability system, relying on the secured and audited implementation by Open Zeppelin.
● Application users will have a Metamask wallet setup and knowledge on how to use it, manage their keys and addresses.

Tech Stack:
● Metamask: wallet integration for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain by a chrome extension
● Hardhat: the development framework for writing, compiling, migrating and deploying smart contracts
● Ether.js: library for interacting with smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain
● Open Zeppelin: packages providing implementation of standards which are already audited and secure
● IPFS: protocol for sharing data, in this case asset meta-data, in a distributed and peer-to-peer system
● Mocha/Chai: tooling for implementing unit testing of smart contracts
● Javascript/HTML/CSS: Front-End Development with Next.js on Top of React.js.
